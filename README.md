Data for the study "Multifaceted functional diversity for multifaceted crop yield: towards ecological assembly rules for varietal mixtures"

Two files are available:

- "RAW_RYT_CWM_FD.xls" contains one row per genotypic mixtures. For each mixture, all components of agronomic performance (RAW_...) and their deviation from the value expected from monocultures (RYT_...) are reported. Likewise, all trait values either computed as community-weighted means (CWMs) or functional diversity (FDs) indexes are reported. 

- "Traits_monocultures.xls" contains one row per genotype. For each genotype, all trait values are reported.

In both files, names of traits and agronomic components are followed by their unit of measurement using a "trait_unit" or "agronomic_component_unit" format. Root traits are preceded by "sem" or "adv" depending if they were measured on seminal or adventitious roots. Reported traits are: "angle_aer" (Aerial angle, °), "angle_root" (Root angle, °), "sem/adv_diameter" (mean root diameter, mm), "sem/adv_SRL" (specific root length, m/g), "sem/adv_RTD" (root tissue density, g/cm3), "sem/adv_RBI" (root branching intensity, nb of root tips/cm), "sem/adv_RLD" (root length density, cm root/cm3 soil), "till_nb" (tiller number per capita), "Ear_bio" (early biomass per capita, g), "SLA" (specific leaf area, m²/kg), "Leaf N" (leaf nitrogen content, %), "height" (plant height, cm), "heading" (heading date, Growing Degree Days), and "maturity" (maturity date, Growing Degree Days).
